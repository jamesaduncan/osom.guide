subtitle: Service Network

---
A service-based organisation is arranged using a network of [services](/services).

The services in the network meet the needs of external users (customers) or internal users (other services).

Each service has a [Service Manager](/service-manager), and a [Service Contract](/service-contract). The contract defines the interface between the service and the rest of the organisation, and the Service Manager is accountable for ensuring the contract is met.
