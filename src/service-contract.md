subtitle: Service Contract

---
Each service has a service contract, and that contract explains the critical information about the service:

1. What the service is and the [user needs](/user-needs) it meets
2. What [lifecycle stage](/lifecycle) the service is at
3. What evolutionary stage the service is at
4. How the service is used
5. How the [performance of the service is measured](/measuring-service-performance/)
6. How to get help when the service isn't performing as expected
7. What other services the service depends upon

There is a [template service contract](/service-contract-template) to help you get started.
