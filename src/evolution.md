An important concept from Wardley mapping that OSOM is built upon heavily is the idea of service evolution. Evolution and lifecycle are not the same; whereas lifecycle is the stage of development a service is at, evolution refers to the relationship between the organisation and the way it regards a service.

[Novel](#novel) services are new and have never been done before. However, they are frequently composed of other services, some of which will be built around [bespoke](#bespoke) components, some around [products](#products), and still others that use [commodities](#commodity).

## Novelties

Novelties are services that are unique. They've rarely been considered before, or they may have some new approach that has not been attempted. In other cases, they represent a service that no other organisation offers due to statutory, or regulatory. For example, only HMRC is able to collect income tax in the United Kingdom.

Novelties should be relatively uncommon in any organisation, and frequently represent a point of interaction with a customer.

## Bespoke, or custom

Services that have been developed with a particular organisation in mind, but can be found in other organisations are bespoke. An example of a bespoke component might be an IVR system for a call centre.
