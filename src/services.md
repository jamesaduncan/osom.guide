OSOM services and the network of interactions they form are two key parts of OSOM, the other being the [executive](/executive).

The service network does the heavy lifting for the organisation. It delivers against the user needs that the organisation attempts to address for third parties or the needs that arise through tackling those.

They're not end-to-end silos or a transaction. They are discrete capabilities that can be assembled as components by other, increasingly higher-order capabilities, ultimately to present those customer journeys to users.

Services are managed by service managers and are periodically assessed by the executive - at minimum each time the service progresses to a new stage in its [lifecycle](/lifecycle/), but regularly once the service goes [live](/lifecycle/#live) also.

## Service governance

To govern the network of services, the [executive](/executive) requires additional information about each service that helps them understand and make changes when needed.
