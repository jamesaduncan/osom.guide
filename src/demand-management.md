subtitle: Demand Management

---
Demand management in OSOM is a simple set of steps that is undertaken whenever there is a proposal for a set of needs not currently met by the [service network](/service-network/).

The [executive ](/executive/)should consider the following questions:

1. Do the proposed needs fit within the scope of an existing service? If so, the service manager should be consulted and the service contract altered. If not, step 2 should be considered.
2. The executive should consider whether or not they want the organisation to meet the proposed needs. If it is determined that the needs should be met, or considered in more detail, go to step 3.
3. A new service, in [Discovery](/lifecycle/#discovery), [should be established](/establishing-a-new-service/).
