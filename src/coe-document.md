A Correction of Error (CoE) document should be published by the [Service Manager](/services/#service-managers) for the service to which it applies. A CoE document should be published whenever a problem occurs - it shouldn't be necessary for the problem to have impacted the users of the service.

The CoE document should contain:

* What the problem was
* What the impact of the problem was
* What the root cause of the problem was
* Data that supports the root cause analysis
* What value tradeoffs were made that led to the problem
* The value tradeoffs that need to be avoided in the future
* Lessons that were learned
* Corrective actions that have been, or will be taken
* Elements of the [better decision making guides](/doctrine/) that made a positive or negative contribution to the problem or its resolution.

The Correction of Error document may then be called upon for further examination during a [Correction of Error process]().
