## Introduction

The OSOM executive both governs the network of services and holds the
managers of those services to account through the variety of
mechanisms documented in the terms of reference.

The executive also has a role in advocating and monitoring the
adoption of doctrine throughout the organisation, which is a
collection of 40 universally useful patterns of behaviour.

## The executive

The executive holds the accountability and responsibility for the
entire scope of the organisation. This includes both the service
network and the executive team.  Membership of the executive team In
an ideal organisation, there would be no requirement for an executive
team. The responsibilities held by the executive, and the activities
required to act upon those responsibilities would be conducted
entirely by a single individual. However, given constraints of time,
complexity and expertise it is unlikely to be possible. Therefore the
executive is responsible for augmenting their skills with the addition
of executive team members who speak with the voice of the executive.

Members of the executive team have authority delegated to them
entirely by the executive who may task them with areas of interest as
they see fit. However, when members of the executive team act, they do
so entirely in the scope of the executive’s accountability and
responsibility and have no individual portfolio per se of their own.

## The role of the executive

The executive has a number of roles and responsibilities in OSOM:

1. Establish, disband, assess and hold services accountable
1. Review and analyse fitness data & maps
1. Issue mandates to manipulate the service network
1. Review Correction of Error documents
1. Consider, publish and endorse guidance
1. Endorse Communities of Practice
1. Mediate between services
1. Monitor and advocate doctrine


## Establish, decommission, assess, alter, and hold services accountable

The primary role of the executive is to establish services; conduct
assessments on them as they progress from discovery to alpha, alpha to
beta, and beta to live; disband the services when no longer needed,
and hold the managers of those services accountable throughout the
[service lifecycle](/lifecycle).

### Establish Services

The Executive establishes a service by publishing a Service Contract
and appointing a Service Manager for the service. Typically, a new
service will start the service lifecycle in discovery and progress
through alpha and beta where the contract will be refined until it is
live.

In some instances - for example, as OSOM is adopted in an existing
organisation - a service contract may be written for a service that
already exists. In this case, the service may not progress through the
service lifecycle as normal, but in all other respects should be
governed as any other service.

### Assess services

Services should be assessed at every stage in their lifecycle, as they
progress from:

* Discovery to alpha
* Alpha to beta
* Beta to live

Once a service has reached its live state, regular assessments should
be conducted to understand service improvements and changes over time.

### Decommission services

In order to ensure the organisation functions both efficiently and
effectively, the Executive should decommission a service when either:

* new user needs are established that it is unable to meet or...
* another service better meets the user's needs or...
* the user’s needs no longer exist.

### Alter services

Occasionally a service contract as written and established through the
service lifecycle will require alteration - a new user need may be
identified, or some other element of the contract may need to be
adjusted.

The executive can do this, but should only do so sparingly: a contract
change has associated risks that should not be ignored.

### Hold services accountable

The Executive is responsible for holding Service Managers accountable
for the services they operate. This includes performance, conformance
to guidance, methodology, doctrine, and any other consideration the
executive wishes.

It should be noted that the Executive does not have the authority to
dictate any of these elements to the service, via the Service Manager,
but it does have the authority to appoint and replace the Service
Manager if it sees fit.

## Review and analyse fitness data & maps

The executive reviews and analyses fitness data published by services,
and Wardley Maps of each service produced by their Service
Managers. The fitness data is used to understand the performance of
the service: is it meeting the needs of the users as intended?

Wardley Maps of each service should be maintained by their respective
Service Manager. The executive uses Wardley Maps to consider the
entirety of the service network, and answer questions such as: are the
services operating in the right way? Are there other services that
could be introduced to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the
service network? Are there services that should be challenged to
industrialize their delivery? Are there services that should be
decommissioned?

Benefits realization should be reported through these mechanisms.

## Issue mandates to manipulate the service network

When changes to services or the service network are foreseen or
desired, the executive issues mandates to the appropriate service
managers. A mandate shouldn’t alter a service contract, but it may
have an impact on the way a service manager chooses to meet the needs
spelt out in that contract.

## Review Correction of Error documents

When problems arise inside services, Service Managers are expected to
publish [Correction of Error](/coe) (CoE) documents to the organisation, which
help it to learn and grow. The executive should review and consider
those CoE documents to understand if there is additional guidance that
should be considered for publication.

The executive should consider conducting a regular meeting with all
Service Managers where CoE documents are reviewed publicly to ensure
a high level of awareness of opportunities for improvement throughout
the organisation’s service network.

## Consider, publish and endorse guidance

The executive is responsible for considering and publishing guidance
that it considers relevant for its service managers to consider. This
may include guidance on technology selection, architectural patterns,
security policies, procurement processes, etc.

This may be guidance from outside the OSOM organisation in the form of
legislation or best practice, or it may be decided upon from within
the service organisation as a result of considering Correction of
Errors.

Where possible, the guidance should be advisory in nature. In general,
Service Managers should be able to consider and reject the guidance
where it is not applicable or appropriate for their particular
service - while being asked to account for the decision in their
service assessments.

## Endorse Communities of Practice

In any service-based model, it can be hard to ensure people are
evaluated fairly, or that they become aware of practices and
opportunities outside of the services they work in. Communities of
Practice (CoPs) exist in OSOM to bridge the gap between the profession
and the service.

CoPs are freely associated with anybody in the organisation. It is up
to the executive to determine when a community has reached a
sufficient level of maturity to assist service managers with guidance
on evaluation for its practitioners, and then endorse that CoP to do
so.

The executive should work with communities of practice to ensure that
where possible all professions are represented by one or more
Communities of Practice.

## Mediate between services

In any service network, disputes will arise between services that
serve each other. When this occurs it is for the executive to mediate
those disputes and find resolution through the mechanisms it already
has: mandates, contract alterations, assessments, etc.  

## Monitor and advocate doctrine

The executive is responsible for advocating and monitoring the
adherence to Wardley’s doctrine.

Wardley’s doctrine is a collection of 40 patterns of behaviour that
are universally applicable to all organisations regardless of
context. Each of the elements of OSOM has been designed in conjunction
with the application of those behaviours, and the executive is
responsible for constantly being aware of opportunities to alter the
operating model more in line with doctrine where needed.
