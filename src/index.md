# Introduction to OSOM

<img class="right pad-left" src="/assets/img/operating-model-overview.png" alt="a diagram showing an overview of the basic parts of OSOM" title="OSOM Overview">

The Organised Services Operating Model (OSOM) is a template operating
model to help organisations adopt a service-based approach. This is in
opposition to a functional model, where capabilities are grouped by
skills and ownership of the delivery to users is an endeavour shared
between those functions.

The operating model has evolved by encouraging a [common set of good behaviours](/doctrine) at multiple organisations and discovering an organisational design and supporting processes that occur as a consequence.

The key components of OSOM are an executive capability that provides
oversight & governance and a network of services that progress through
a simple [service lifecycle](/lifecycle) compatible with the
[Government Digital
Service's](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)
[service manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual).

## A template operating model

OSOM is a template operating model. Each organisation is different,
and few organisations would be directly mappable onto OSOM
directly. Instead, it forms a general approach that should be
carefully adapted as needed to the organisation.

The key to adapting an operating model for any organisation is to be aware of the trade-offs being made with each compromise, both positive and negative. That way, governance can be established to balance the negative consequences, and full advantage can be taken of positive consequences.

## Elements of OSOM

### The executive

The [OSOM executive](/executive) governs the network of services and
holds the managers of those services to account through various
mechanisms documented in terms of reference.

The executive also has a role in advocating and monitoring the adoption of [guides to better decisions](/doctrine) throughout the organisation, which provides a collection of 40 universally useful patterns of behaviour that should be encouraged wherever possible.

### The service network

[OSOM services](/services/) address the needs of users. For any given
service, the users may be external to the organisation, internal, or a
mixture of both.

Each service is built & operated by a Service Manager, who is
accountable for the service and the team required in all its lifecycle
phases - from discovery until its eventual retirement.
