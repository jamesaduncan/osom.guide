subtitle: 'Origins'

---
The Organised Services Operating Model (OSOM) originated from the research and discussion
behind Simon Wardley's [Wardley Maps book](https://medium.com/wardleymaps), and years of
application by [Stance](http://stance.consulting/).  The operating model has evolved by
encouraging a [common set of good behaviours](/doctrine) at multiple organisations and
discovering an organisational design and supporting processes that occur as a consequence.

## Previous documentation

This site is an evolution of the original [OSOM
documentation](http://stance.consulting/osom/). While the
documentation almost certainly remains incomplete, this site takes
precedence and overrides any contradictions between the two.
