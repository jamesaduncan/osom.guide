subtitle: Capital Flow Management

---
Capital Flow Management is a system of administering how money flows through the organisation, starting with a transaction created by the user.

Each service that is consumed as a result of that transaction has an associated cost, which is measured and recorded so that the flow of money through the organisation is visible and understood from top to the bottom.
