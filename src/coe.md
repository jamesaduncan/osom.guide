The Correction of Error (CoE) process was inspired by the [AWS](https://wa.aws.amazon.com/wat.concept.coe.en.html) Well-Architected framework and acts as a [systematic method of learning](/doctrine#do-we-use-systematic-mechanisms-of-learning) for the organisation's service network.

## The Correction of Errors review

[{{ exec | ucfirst }}](/executive) should [conduct regular reviews](/executive#review-correction-of-error-documents) with all {{ sm }}s of the unreviewed, published [CoE documents](/coe-document). This review allows other {{ sm }}s to benefit from the experience of the error, without being a part of the service team that experienced the error.
