## Service Description
_write description here_

Define:
 - What the business benefit is

As a _user A_ or _user B_  
I need _xyz_  
so that _outcome_

## Service Measures
 - _define aggregate metrics that show how this outcome is met_

Define:
 - What user needs this services exists to meet
 - High level, not fine-grained requirements (eg: if you find you’re writing out steps in a process you’re likely going too deep!)
 - You don’t need to write out an onboarding / offboarding need.
 - If your service meets any targets (eg: availability ≥ 99.999%), write that as a need
 - Brainstorm outcome metrics for each need (this feeds into service metrics below).

## Service Metrics
 - _aggregated list of outcome metrics the service reports on_

Define:
 - Metrics that show how the outcomes of each user need are met
 - How are costs reported?
 - How is consumption measured?
 - Add targets only where applicable

## Service Dependencies
 - _list any internal services you need here_
