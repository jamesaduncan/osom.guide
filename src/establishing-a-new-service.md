There are two occasions likely to arise where a new service might be needed. The first is that a set of previously unmet needs is identified - this could be as a new product line for the end consumer, or it could be to enhance how internal services work.

The second circumstance occurs when two or more existing services are addressing a need within their service boundary and the opportunity to remove duplication exists by consolidating that capability as a shared service that they - and other services could consume instead.

To establish the service in both cases, a service contract should be drafted that documents the user needs, a {{ sm }} should be appointed by {{ exec }} and a budget allocated for the discovery [phase of development](/lifecycle/).

When the discovery concludes, the outcome should be presented to the executive with the understanding that what has been learned may influence the contents of the service contract.

### Steps required to draft a service contract

1. Name the service
2. Define users & their needs
3. Define metrics for each outcome
4. Write service description
5. List any known service dependencies
6. Consider the stage of evolution for service as a whole
7. Assign a {{ sm }}
