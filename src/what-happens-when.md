## ...a service doesn't spend its budget

When a service finds savings against its budget, it should be free to invest that budget elsewhere if needed.

## ...a service needs additional funding

If a service feels that it cannot meet the needs enumerated in its service contract with the budget it has available, the [service manager](/service-manager/) should engage in a dialogue with the [executive ](/executive/)to either narrow the scope of the service or to expand the budget.

## ...a service chooses not to use another service

A [service manager](/service-manager/) is free to decide to use or not use another, existing service within the organisation. The executive may disagree with that decision, and dialogue during a service assessment to help to establish a shared understanding of the best approach. This is particularly true of services that are in early [lifecycle](/lifecycle/) stages.

The executive should use the service assessment to either help guide the service towards a more effective way of achieving its goals, or as a signal detection mechanism to understand unmet [user needs](/user-needs/) or services that aren't as effective as they could be.

## ...a service team member feels they've been evaluated incorrectly?

[Service team members](/service-team-members/) are line managed, and as a consequence, performance managed by their [service manager](/service-manager/). This allows for accountability for all elements of the service to be held by the service manager, but can sometimes result in individuals feeling that their line management is being conducted by someone who doesn't really understand their profession and how to evaluate it.

[Communities of Practice](/community-of-practice/) play a part in this, providing guidance to service managers on how to evaluate their professional members - as do Capability Frameworks. Where there is an intractable difference of opinion, the service team member can have the Community of Practice escalate the concern to the executive, who then mediate the disagreement.
