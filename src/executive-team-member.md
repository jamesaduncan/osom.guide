Members of {{ execgroup }} have authority delegated to them by {{ exec }} who may task them with areas of interest as they see fit.

However, when members of {{ execgroup }} act, they do so entirely in the scope of {{ exec }}â€™s accountability and responsibility and have no individual portfolio of their own _per se_.

This isn't to say that those members shouldn't have opinions, skills and specialisms. {{ execgroup | ucfirst }} as a whole needs to be able to assess finance, consider security and balance risk, understand strategy, and everything else that would be considered a constraint or an enabler in a modern organisation.

The important thing is ensuring that their interests are fully and completely aligned with the executive: they have no portfolio and no agenda of their own.
