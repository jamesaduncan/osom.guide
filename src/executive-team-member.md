subtitle: Executive Team Member

---
Members of the executive team have authority delegated to them by the executive who may task them with areas of interest as they see fit. 

However, when members of the executive team act, they do so entirely in the scope of the executive’s accountability and responsibility and have no individual portfolio of their own _per se_.

This isn't to say that those members shouldn't have opinions, skills and specialisms however. The executive team as a whole needs to be able to assess finance, consider security and balance risk, understand strategy, and everything else that would be considered a constraint or an enabler in a modern organisation.
