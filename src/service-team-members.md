Service teams are made up of team members. Team members may be in any profession, and of any discipline.

Service team members are appointed by a [{{ sm }}](/service-managers), or by the management structure appointed by the {{ sm }}. The line management of service team members also follows this organisation as well as any associated processes, such as performance management.

It is recommended that the roles of service team members should be defined using a structured professional framework such as HMG's [Digital, Data & Technology (DDaT) profession](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/digital-data-and-technology-profession), [Skills for the Information Age (SFIA)](https://sfia-online.org/en), or any other suitable definition of job families, roles, skills and skill levels.
